     _________________________________________________________________
All systems:  Major bugfixes.
     _________________________________________________________________

IMPORTANT:  This release of OpenAFS fixes a remotely exploitable denial
	    of service attack on all platforms.  Users are strongly
	    encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.

All systems:

- Use private xdr, not kernel provided one, to avoid memory ownership 
  conflicts that can lead to system crashes.
- Rework GetCellServDB RPC to avoid a deadlock and return useful information.
- Fix multiple race conditions in fileserver to avoid crashes.
- Do not allow AFS to be shutdown before it is unmounted.

Solaris:
- Cast times to int to avoid overflow and negative dates.

Darwin/Mac OS X:
- Recognize MacOS X 10.1.5 as a ppc_darwin_14 system at build time.
