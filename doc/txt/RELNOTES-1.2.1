                  OpenAFS Release Notes - Version 1.2.1
     _________________________________________________________________
Linux clients: Major bugfix
All other systems: Minor updates
     _________________________________________________________________

All systems:
- com_err implementation is now compatible with all other known
  implementations. This should have no visible effect to OpenAFS
  clients and servers; However, users of OpenAFS libraries will need to
  make sure to include the appropriate headers (99% of such applications
  will already do so) and any users of previous versions of OpenAFS 
  compile_et or IBM/Transarc compile_et with error tables including
  lowercase characters in their names will now have new error codes 
  allocated. Again, most users of com_err will use some other compile_et,
  which is included in most Kerberos distributions and virtually all other
  com_err using packages.
- source cleanup has been undertaken to remove unused variables. This work
  is part of an ongoing effort.

Linux:
- All Linux versions have a bug fix to make writes of files larger than
  the AFS client cache work. This undoes a fix which attempted to correct
  a problem where some writes neither succeeded nor failed
  (including cases where a file write to an over-quota volume is being 
  attempted, a problem affecting all OpenAFS versions since release from IBM).
- Linux 2.2 PowerPC should install correctly again

Digital UNIX:
- vfsck will now check for and exit if a partition is mounted.

Windows NT/2000:
- AFS Configuration Wizard will not check for version >= 3.5
- Makefiles have more complete support for "make clean"

OpenBSD:
- User processes (but not kernel module/cache manager) included but not ready
  for general deployment.

Documentation:
- README.CVS explains how to use OpenAFS CVS
- NEWS file updated
