                  OpenAFS Release Notes - Version 1.2.9
     _________________________________________________________________
New platform support.
All systems: New functionality and minor bugfixes.
     _________________________________________________________________

* kaserver defaults to disallowing interrealm authentication.

Due to security holes present in the Kerberos 4 protocol, the kaserver
now defaults to disallowing interrealm authentication.  This functionality
can be restored by supplying the "-crossrealm" flag to the kaserver.
However, note that doing so is considered a significant security risk.

* New platform support: RedHat Linux 9.0, Solaris 9 12/02, server only
  support for Tru64 5.1.

All systems:

- rxkad 2b will now do krb4/krb5 principal name translation.

- Always include errno.h instead of declaring "extern int errno", for
  compatability with modern glibc.

- Fix race conditions in fileserver responsible for various fileserver
  crashes.

- Fix a deadlock condition in the fileserver that could occur at shutdown
  time.

- Fix fileserver logging to be more verbose and to specify ports in the
  correct byte order.

- Rewrite of cell handling code, to allow for more consistant behavior
  across reboots.  This also allows clients to have an empty CellServDB
  as long as AFSDB support is enabled and ThisCell has AFSDB records.

  A consequence of this is that an OpenAFS 1.2.9 afsd will not work
  with kernel modules from OpenAFS releases prior to 1.2.9.  In general,
  using mismatched afsd/kernel module pairs are considered unsupported;
  it is not recommended that you use such a configuration on a regular
  basis.

- Corrected integer overflow in xdrmem_getbytes() routine in our xdr
  implementation, even thought it's unused.

Solaris:

- Autoconf glue added to correctly build on Solaris 9 12/02, which replaced
  the fs_rlink member of a struct fs with with fs_rolled.

- Kernel module now no longer uses the depricated newproc() function,
  instead using thread_create to spawn a kernel thread.

- Repaired Solaris x86 support.

Linux:

- On machines using 2.2 series kernels, 2.2.19 or higher is now required.

- Notice NETUNREACH errors and timeout attempts to access AFS quickly
  when we're not on the network.

- rxk listener shutdown code rewritten to no longer need sys_kill.

- Search for linux kernel headers in both /usr/src/linux-2.4 and
  /usr/src/linux at build time.

MacOS X:

- Recognize MacOS X 10.2.3, 10.2.4, and 10.2.5 as ppc_darwin_60 at
  build time.

AIX:

- Make the salvager work on namei fileserver partitions.

Tru64:

- Allow server binaries to be built on Tru64 5.1.  No client support yet.
