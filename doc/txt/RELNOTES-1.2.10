* Bugfixes:

All systems:

- A bug in fileserver logging of hosts which appear to change UUIDs 
  that could cause a crash was fixed.

- A condition which could cause a client to loop in afs_FetchStatus 
  forever due to never triggering an end condition was corrected.

- The namei fileserver could create files with one "tag" but try to open
  with another due to an erroneous parent volume ID being passed into the
  volume package by the volserver.

- Avoid copying erroneous IP addresses when the primary IP address is masked 
  from Ubik by NetInfo or NetRestrict.

- Avoid crashing fileserver when mapname attempts to map a foreign user.

- Add cellaliases found with AFSDB for cells in CellServDB, returning to 
  1.2.8 behavior.

- Avoid potential shutdown deadlock in fileserver.

- Avoid deadlock on afsconf reread (AFS key change, CellServDB update) in
  servers.

- More volume errors are translated for on the wire to avoid error
  conflicts between operating systems.

- Make butc able to backup to and restore from large files on platform
  which support it.

Linux: 

- Return setgroups errors correctly.

- Fix GCPAGs support.

- Busy out cache partition while in use.

- Don't allow afsd to shut down while AFS is mounted.

Solaris:

- x86 Solaris has a bug fixed which caused shutdown to not work due to
  double byteswapping a port.

- kdump64 should be built if possible by default.

- Deal with changes to kernel read_binding_file() routine.

MacOS X:

- Work around finder problems with caching of access() results.

- Allow multiple mounts of AFS.

- Support Disk Arbitration for AFS.

- Don't unmount AFS unless forced, to preclude accidental "ejection" of AFS.

- Support -nomount in afsd to allow startup without mounting AFS.

Windows:

- Fix large integer support for VC7.

- Reset state while servicing SMB event loop.

- Avoid erroneous "No Such Volume" errors.

- Versioning for all files.

- Correctly report directories by not setting incorrect field in SMB 
  structure.
