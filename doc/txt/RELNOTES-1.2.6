                  OpenAFS Release Notes - Version 1.2.6
     _________________________________________________________________
Linux clients: Major bugfixes
All systems: Minor updates and new functionality
     _________________________________________________________________

Note: FreeBSD is not supported in this release.  FreeBSD support is
      present in the OpenAFS CVS mainline.  Users interested in FreeBSD
      support should try one of our CVS snapshots.

All systems:

- Mountpoint directory information can now be faked by the cache manager,
  making operations such as stat'ing all cells under /afs much faster.
  This is enabled by passing the -fakestat flag to afsd.
- Update xdr so internal variables match waht's being passed in, and use
  our private copy of xdr for user space applications as well.
- Correctly compile the kerberos-aware PAM module.
- "vos listaddrs" can now print uuids, and supports a -n option to not
   reverse resolve IP addresses.
- When it fails to parse a cacheinfo file, afsd will not attempt to print
  any fields of the file in the error message.
- Properly compile butc object file with AFS_PTHREAD_ENV defined to fix
  deadlocker problem in butc.
- Fixed operator precedence bug causing new pags to sometimes be erroneously
  set.
- Fixed case where getcell pioctl might skip cells when called sequentially.
- Ack fssync operations earlier so as not to tie up the volserver 
  unnecessarily.

Solaris:
- Fix compilation error on Solaris 9 FCS.
- Added support for Solaris 7 and 8 x86.
- Correctly check for 32 bit file size limitations.
- Properly translate return values from vm routines into errno values.
- NFS translator kernel module compiles again, but is not built or installed
  by default.

Linux:
- Fix compilation error on Redhat 2.4.18-5 kernel.
- If running with dynroot, the rc script on Linux will start AFS even
  if network is not available.
- Deal with receiving EAGAIN from recvfrom().
- gcpags support now exists, but is not enabled by default.
- Fix problems causing SMP clients to sometimes miss wakeups.
- Properly remove dentries for unlinked files.
- Backport partial write support from the mainline.
- If we're holding the GLOCK, attempt to drop it before calling
  osi_linux_alloc().
- Attempt allocate up to PAGE_SIZE with kmalloc() before calling vmalloc().
- Translate struct fcntl back into Linux's struct file_lock so that
  fcntl(F_GETLK) returns a correct value to the user.

D/UX:
- Updates for better support on D/UX 5.0.

Darwin/MacOS X:
- Long running processing running out of AFS will no longer cause many
  syslog messages.
