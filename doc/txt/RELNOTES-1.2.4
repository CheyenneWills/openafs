- Clients allocates correct string size when creating symlinks and
  files.  
- Logfiles more consistant about referring to hosts in a IP
  adress:port number format, rather than a memory address or hex IP.
- Converted vcache casting in cache manager to macros, to ease future changes.
- Avoid kernel panic when dynroot and memcache are used simultaneously.
- General enhancements to test suite, including a functioning Solaris port.

Solaris:
