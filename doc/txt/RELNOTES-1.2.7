                  OpenAFS Release Notes - Version 1.2.7
     _________________________________________________________________
New platform support.
All systems: New functionality and minor bugfixes.
     _________________________________________________________________

This is the first OpenAFS 1.2.x release to support MacOS X 10.2 (aka
"Jaguar") and FreeBSD 4.3 and later.  The FreeBSD client is still
under development, and should not be used except by those doing development
on the OpenAFS FreeBSD client.

Additionally, support for building all userland code on SunOS 4 is now
present.  The kernel module and any code that depends on filesystem layout
(vfsck, salvager) are not supported.

All systems:

- The fileserver will now use rx pings to determine that clients are reachable
  before allocating threads to them.  This prevents asymmetric clients from
  consuming all resources on a fileserver.

- Support the "NetInfo" file to better support clients/servers being used
  in conjuction with a NAT.

- Return ENODEV instead of ELOOP when traversing a mountpoint boundary from
  a BK volume to a BK volume, to prevent find from getting a fatal error
  when traversing a directory tree with backup volumes mounted.

- "vos listaddrs" will now correctly display all server IP addresses registered
  in the VLDB.

- The "bos restart" usage message has been corrected to not imply that the
  "-all" flag is the default.

- Allow users with admin bits to store different user/group IDs along
  with a StoreData call; they can already do so anyway by using
  StoreStatus.  Fixes a spurious permission denied error with arla
  clients.

- The bosserver will not create directories it won't use.

- "fs newcell" will now work even when there are no cells in the kernel yet.

- Shared library versions of libafsrpc and libafsauthent are now compiled.

- ACL the ptserver dumpentry RPC to superusers or those with readonly access 
  to the entire database.

- Do length checking so we can reject tokens too large to be valid with a 
  useful error.

Solaris:
- Set the maxfilesize rlimit to infinity while writing to cache files to 
  avoid potential truncation if the user's rlimit is too low.

Linux:
- Update to support newer 2.2.x kernels.
- Make Linux gcpags support SMP safe.
- Provide kernel thread support in the client.
- Correctly compute the size of our cache.

MacOS X/Darwin:
- MacOS X 10.2 support integrated, includes misc. bug fixes relevant to the
  client on 10.1.
- Work around MacOS X Finder's behavior by returning ENOENT when the user
  tries to look up Contents or .DS_Store in an uncached volume root.

AIX:
- The namei fileserver and salvager should now work on AIX.

Windows:
- Fix some build errors.
