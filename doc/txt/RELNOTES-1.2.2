                  OpenAFS Release Notes - Version 1.2.2
     _________________________________________________________________
Linux clients: Major bugfix
All other systems: Minor updates
     _________________________________________________________________

All systems:
- com_err patch included in 1.2.1 was missing a macro in generated
  headers from .et source files. compile_et is now fixed.
- source cleanup has been undertaken to remove unused variables. This work
  is part of an ongoing effort.
- fileserver will now correctly reap deleted clients. A bug previously
  could preclude a client from being reaped if the client was marked
  deleted and became active again before the 5 minute check LWP cleaned
  it up.
- fileserver now supports InlineBulk RPC to cut down round trips on
  directories including unreadable files
- fileserver is careful to avoid null pointer dereference if a callback
  entry in the chain has been invalidated (possibly related to problem
  fixed with reaping clients)
- bosserver logs process exit statuses
- vos can now encrypt volume dumps
- vos now has a setfields option
- vos restore now supports the -offline option to not bring volumes online
  after restoring
- vos restore now supports the -readonly option to mark a restored volume
  readonly. This cannot be done if a readwrite volume already exists.
- upclient cleans up after failures instead of leaving files in /tmp
- rxdebug now has a -long option to increase verbosity
- cache manager is careful to not dereference null pointers when reordering
  server preferences
- bos problem where potential false errors on salvage could be reported is
  fixed
- namei fileserver will attach appropriately named directories if they
  contain a file named AlwaysAttach exists in them

All UNIX systems:
- dynamic root (/afs) support has been added. Invoke afsd with the -dynroot
  switch. 
- fix a minor vcache leak in the cache manager when a dangling mount point
  is evaluated

IRIX:
- Rx now computes MTU correctly.
- Use bcopy/bzero/bcmp for kernel modules since memset/memcmp/memcpy is
  not supported

Solaris:
- Solaris 9 is now supported.
- Rx now computes MTU correctly.

Linux:
- All Linux versions have a bug fixed where the kernel dentry cache would
  interfere with AFS vcache entries from being deleted could lead to
  an oops suggesting a VLRU cycle.
- Rx now computes MTU correctly.
- Linux 2.4 on Alpha should now build correctly
- Previously added umount_begin support has been removed as it could
  cause problems for hosts where processes were still using AFS when the
  cache manager was shut down.
- RC file has been cleaned up

Windows NT/2000:
- Freelance (dynamic AFS root) and AFSDB support are included

Documentation:
- NEWS file updated
